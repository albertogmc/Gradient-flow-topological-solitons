# Gradient-flow-topological-solitons
Codes for developing the gradient flow optimization algorithm applied to finding  topological soliton solutions in non-linear field theories.
## Contents
Currrently there are two codes:

[kink_gradientflow.py](../master/kink_gradientflow.py): Application of the gradient flow method to generate kink solutions (1 dimension).

[Baby_Skyrme_GF.py](../master/Baby_Skyrme_GF.py): Application of the gradient flow method to generate baby skyrmions (2 dimensions).
